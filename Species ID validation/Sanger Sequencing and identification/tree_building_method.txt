# Sanger sequences identified by the NCBI Blast tool as _Pangaeus_, as well as sequences from samples identified as _Dallasiellus_ by Dr Mark Abney, were generated using primers BF3-BR2 that target 418 bp long region of the COI mitochondrial gene (Elbrecht et al., 2019).

# These sequences were used to build a phylogenetic tree to further confirm sample identification for samples used for diet analysis. Here, we use Geneious to handle sequences and build a phylogenetic tree.

# In Geneious forward and reverse reads were aligned and the merged pairs (consensus) were aligned against each other. One sample, 1921-2, had to be reverse-complemented because otherwise it would not align well to all other sequences. Next, sequences downloaded from NCBI, comprising other look-alike burrower bug species and an outgroup taxon (Scutelleridae) were aligned against each other, repeated sequences were removed, and sequences that did not align well (likely not COI and mislabelled at NCBI) were also removed. In addition to these sequences, a _Cyrtomenus_ _ciliatus_ sequence previously generated by Michael Crossley was also added to this alignment. Sequences from our 2021 samples that aligned poorly to the low-mapper genome, as well as _P._ _bilineatus_ sequences from NCBI were also added as reference. Finally, sample 19301, previously identified via NCBI Blast as _Tominotus_ (possibly a third species that was accidentally sampled), was also included. According to Blast, sample 19301 has 94.5% query cover and 86.8% similarity to _Tominotus_ which is a sister genus to both _Pangaeus_ and _Dallasiellus_. All these sequences were added together and a multiple alignment was executed using Clustal Omega within Geneious.


Step-by-Step

1. Create directory with all Sanger sequences
In Geneious, folder BurrowerBug -> "Tree Building - manuscript"

2. Assemble sequences (BF3-BR2 sample amplicons and 19301, a 694bp long sequenced obtained by PCR using primers LepF2t1 and LepR1 (Park et al., 2011), with overlap to region amplified by BF3-BR2)

In Geneious, Align/Assemble -> De Novo Assemble -> Assemble by 1st part of name, separated by _B, use existing trimming regions, assembler Geneious, highest sensitivity/Slow, don't merge variants with coverage approximately 6, merge homopolymer variants

3. Align sequences to reference COI and exclude spurious sequences
3.1 For sequences that failed to align, select high-quality reads (more than 75% Q20, length longer than 100bp), and map to a reference _Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_ (in this case, NCBI accession number KR031248.1). Try to re-assemble sequences that align well to the reference.
Obs. There are two pairs of sequences named "1105_2" and "1105-2". The pair 1105_2 is low quality and were discarded. The pair 1105-2 is high-quality and was successfully assembled.
3.2. Align all salvaged sequences and successfully assembled sequences together
3.2.1 First, reverse 1921-2 that, as observed earlier, would otherwise not align well to other Sanger sequences or reference sequences
3.2.2 Next, make a consensus alignment for all consensus sequences, including reversed-1921-2
3.2.3 Map consensus alignment and salvaged sequences to Pangaeus

Tree is built using FastTree within Geneious, with default settings (or command-line FastTree_MacOS -quote -cat 20 -nt input.fasta).
