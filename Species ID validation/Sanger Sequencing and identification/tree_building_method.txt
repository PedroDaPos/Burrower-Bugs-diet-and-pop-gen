# Preliminary data indicated that samples with low alignment against our reference _Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_ draft genome were likely _Dallasiellus_ _lugubris_. However, NCBI lacked any reference COI sequence for _Dallasiellus_ _lugubris_, and blast results identified these samples as "Scutelleridae", or Cydnidae by the BOLD database. Here we use Geneious to handle these sequences and build a phylogenetic tree, including reference sequences, to identify our samples more precisely to species level.

# Among samples collected in 2021 we selected 27 samples presumed to be _Dallasiellus_ _lugubris_, 2 samples presumed to be _Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_, and 1 sample of unknown identification. Species identification was determined accordingly to their highest rate of alignment to either of our reference genomes, or poor alignment to both of them (in the case of the unknown species). These samples were amplified using primers BF3-BR2 that target a 418bp long region of the COI mitochondrial gene (Elbrecht et al., 2019), and submitted for Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics LLC, KY, USA). The unknown species sample yielded poor quality sequences, and thus discarded. We replaced this sample in downstream analysis with sample 1-9-30-1, which was previously sequenced using a different set of COI primers (LepF2t1 and LepR1, Park et al., 2011), that amplifies a 694bp long region of the COI gene that overlaps with the region amplified by BF3-BR2.

# In Geneious forward and reverse reads were aligned and the merged pairs (consensus) were aligned against each other. One sample, 1921-2, had to be reverse-complemented because otherwise it would not align well to all other sequences. Next, we added the following sequences downloaded from NCBI and the BOLD database to the dataset:
Accession Taxonomy
HM374391.1  Sehirus cinctus
HQ928981.1  Sehirus cinctus
MG406265.1  Sehirus cinctus
KR34293.1 Sehirus sp.
KR342012.1  Sehirus sp.
MW983889.1  Cyrtomenus bergi
HM889260.1  Cyrtomenus mirabilis
MW982635.1  Cyrtomenus ciliatus
MH643815.1  "Cydnidae"
KR034119.1  Pangaeus bilineatus
KR040233.1  Pangaeus bilineatus
KR031248.1  Pangaeus bilineatus
MW983094.1  Tominotus sp.
MW982311.1  Tominotus sp.
BAHAR116-14 (BOLD)  "Cydnidae"

These sequences were chosen to represent other burrower bugs Genera found in the region (_Sehirus_ and _Cyrtomenus_), _Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_, _Tominotus_ (best match on NCBI to the unknown species in the dataset), and other "Cydnidae" that NCBI/BOLD has indicated as closely related to our _Pangaeus_ and _Dallasiellus_ samples. In addition, we also added a COI sequence we sequenced for a _Cyrtomenus_ _ciliatus_ collected in the same region. All these sequences were added together and a multiple alignment was executed using Clustal Omega within Geneious Prime.


# Step-by-Step (using Geneious Prime version 2023.2.1, Build 2023-07-20)

1. Create directory with all Sanger sequences
E.g. "Burrower Bugs Tree"

2. Assemble sequences (BF3-BR2 sample amplicons and 19301, a 694bp long sequenced obtained by PCR using primers LepF2t1 and LepR1 (Park et al., 2011), with overlap to region amplified by BF3-BR2)

In Geneious, Align/Assemble -> De Novo Assemble -> Assemble by 1st part of name, separated by _B, use existing trimming regions, assembler Geneious, highest sensitivity/Slow, don't merge variants with coverage approximately 6, merge homopolymer variants

3. Align sequences to reference COI (_Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_, KR031248.1) and exclude spurious sequences
3.1 For sequences that failed to assemble (Step 2), select high-quality reads (more than 75% Q20, length longer than 100bp), and map to the same reference _Pangaeus_ _bilineatus_ (KR031248.1). If applicable, troubleshoot and re-assemble sequences that align well to the reference. Copy salvaged sequences to the same folder where sequences aligned in the previous step are stored.
Obs. There are two pairs of sequences named "1105_2" and "1105-2". The pair 1105_2 is low quality and were discarded. The pair 1105-2 is high-quality and was successfully assembled.
3.2. Align salvaged sequences and successfully assembled sequences together. Specifically:
  3.2.1 First, reverse 1921-2 that, as observed earlier, would otherwise not align well to other Sanger sequences or reference sequences
  3.2.2 Next, make a consensus alignment for all consensus sequences, including reversed-1921-2
  3.2.3 Map consensus alignment and salvaged sequences to Pangaeus (KR031248.1)
  3.2.4 Trim alignment to the greatest section of overlap across sequences

Tree is built using FastTree within Geneious, with default settings (or command-line FastTree_MacOS -quote -cat 20 -nt input.fasta).
